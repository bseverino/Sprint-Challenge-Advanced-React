- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

Using class components gives you access to the Component Lifecycle.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

render(): Returns some piece of DOM.
componentDidMount(): Function(s) that gets called after the render method is called for the first time (ie axios).
componentDidUpdate(): Runs any time the state is changed or new props are received.

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

Custom hooks allow us to build our own stateful logic to use over and over again.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

Testing makes us confident in how our app works, and lessens the chance of human error.
